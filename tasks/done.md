# Done

## F01 — Monorepo skeleton ✓
- **Tests:** smoke check — `pnpm install` resolves the workspace (prettier + turbo installed)
- **Files changed:** 13 new (root configs + tasks/ folder)
- **Lines:** +~300
- **Complexity:** Low — pure tooling/configs, no logic
- **Notes:**
  - `just` skipped (not installed); root `pnpm` scripts orchestrate everything, calling `uv run` for Python tasks. Can swap to `just` later if desired.
  - Single-deployable contract documented in CLAUDE.md — no branching on `TIKKO_DEPLOY_MODE` in business logic.
  - All env vars use `TIKKO_*` prefix.
  - Git initialized on `main` with per-feature commit convention.

## F02 — CI workflow ✓
- **Tests:** smoke check — YAML parses; 5 jobs detected (workspace, api, web, mobile, packages)
- **Files changed:** 1 new (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Lines:** +~115
- **Complexity:** Low — single workflow file
- **Notes:**
  - Each app-specific job is gated by `if: hashFiles(...)` so the workflow doesn't fail before F03/F04/F05 land.
  - Workspace job (install + prettier check) runs unconditionally.
  - Uses `pnpm/action-setup@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4` w/ pnpm cache, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6` for the Python api.
  - Concurrency group set to cancel superseded runs on the same ref.

## F03 — API skeleton ✓
- **Tests:** 2/2 passing (`test_health_returns_ok`, `test_health_is_unauthenticated`)
- **Files changed:** 7 new (pyproject.toml, README, src/tikko/{__init__,settings,main}.py, tests/{__init__,conftest,test_health}.py) + uv.lock
- **Lines:** +~150 src/test + lockfile
- **Complexity:** Low — `/health` route, settings class, two assertion tests
- **Notes:**
  - Deps: fastapi[standard], pydantic-settings, sqlalchemy[asyncio], alembic, psycopg[binary], structlog, pyzk 0.9. Dev: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx, ruff.
  - Used `[dependency-groups].dev` (modern uv) instead of deprecated `[tool.uv].dev-dependencies`.
  - `Settings.deploy_mode` is a `StrEnum` (`lan`/`cloud`). Re-iterated in docstring: deploy_mode affects bindings/TLS/defaults only, never business logic.
  - `get_settings()` returns a cached singleton; tests can patch it later.
  - Ruff config in `pyproject.toml`, `select = [E,W,F,I,B,UP,RUF]`; clean.

## F04 — Web skeleton ✓
- **Tests:** 2/2 passing (Home renders the tikko heading; links to /devices)
- **Files changed:** 10 new (package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, vitest.setup.ts, .eslintrc.json, next-env.d.ts, app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/__tests__/home.test.tsx) + pnpm-lock updates
- **Lines:** +~150 src/test
- **Complexity:** Low — single page + smoke component test
- **Notes:**
  - Next 15.1, React 19, TypeScript 5.7, Vitest 2.1, jsdom 25
  - `outputFileTracingRoot` pinned to repo root to silence Next's "multiple lockfiles" warning (there's a stray `package-lock.json` somewhere up the directory tree).
  - `next lint` is deprecated in Next 15.x and will be removed in Next 16. Migration to `eslint` CLI + flat config deferred to a future feature (will tackle alongside Next 16 upgrade).
  - Tests run with `pnpm --filter @tikko/web test` via vitest.
  - Strict TDD: RED was implicit (test imports `../page` which didn't exist); didn't observe a failing vitest run separately because pnpm install hadn't completed yet. Future features will do explicit RED → GREEN.

## F05 — Mobile skeleton ✓
- **Tests:** 2/2 jest (Home renders heading + tagline)
- **Files:** package.json, app.json, tsconfig.json, babel.config.js, jest.setup.ts, .eslintrc.json, expo-env.d.ts, app/_layout.tsx, app/index.tsx, app/__tests__/index.test.tsx
- **Complexity:** Medium — Expo + pnpm + jest required custom transformIgnorePatterns; expo lint auto-downgraded eslint from 9 to 8 and required legacy `.eslintrc.json` (not flat config).
- **Stack:** Expo 52, expo-router 4, React 18.3, RN 0.76, jest 29 with jest-expo preset.
- **Pnpm quirk:** transformIgnorePatterns must match `node_modules/.pnpm/...` paths — broadened pattern with `.*` prefix.

## F06 — Shared packages ✓
- **Tests:** 8/8 (shared-types 6, api-client 2), typecheck clean both
- **Files:** packages/{shared-types,api-client}/{package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts, src/index.test.ts}
- **Stack:** zod 3, openapi-fetch 0.13, openapi-typescript 7 (devDep, for `pnpm codegen`)
- **Notes:**
  - `@tikko/shared-types` exposes `DeviceSchema`, `DevicePunchSchema`, `DeployMode`, `UserRole` (mirrors api StrEnum)
  - `@tikko/api-client` wraps `openapi-fetch`; types loose until F07 lands the first endpoint, then `pnpm codegen` regenerates from `apps/api/openapi.json`
  - Packages exported as raw source (`main: src/index.ts`), no build step — TS consumers resolve directly via `moduleResolution: bundler`

## F07 — Device model + register ✓
- **Tests:** 8/8 (6 device + 2 health), ruff clean
- **Files:** src/tikko/{db,main}.py, src/tikko/models/{__init__,device}.py, src/tikko/schemas/{__init__,device}.py, src/tikko/routes/{__init__,devices}.py, tests/{conftest,test_devices}.py
- **Routes:** POST /devices (201), GET /devices (paginated list with total), GET /devices/{id} (404 on miss)
- **DB:** SQLAlchemy 2.x async, in-memory SQLite for tests (aiosqlite), Postgres in prod. `Base.metadata.create_all` on lifespan startup; Alembic deferred.
- **Notes:**
  - Patterns established: `SessionDep` annotated dep, `from_attributes=True` Pydantic config, response envelope `{ items, total }` for lists, UUID strings as IDs (sqlite-friendly), `created_at` defaulted with `datetime.now(UTC)`
  - conftest overrides `get_session` and resets `db_module._engine` per test for full isolation

## F08 — pyzk wrapper + test-connection ✓
- **Tests:** 11/11 (3 new: returns device info, 404 unknown device, 503 unreachable)
- **Files:** src/tikko/zk/{__init__,client}.py, src/tikko/schemas/zk.py, route added to devices.py
- **Wrapper:** `ZKClient.test_connection()` is synchronous (pyzk is sync); route wraps it with `asyncio.to_thread(...)` to keep the event loop free
- **Errors:** `ZKConnectionError` → HTTP 503 with detail; unknown device → 404
- **Tested via:** `unittest.mock.patch("tikko.routes.devices.ZKClient.test_connection", ...)` — no real device or network needed

## F09 — Attendance log poll ✓
- **Tests:** 15/15 (4 new: poll inserts + count, idempotent dedup, 404, list)
- **Files:** src/tikko/models/attendance.py, src/tikko/schemas/attendance.py, ZKClient.get_attendance(), 2 new routes
- **Routes:** POST /devices/{id}/poll → `{ polled, new }`, GET /devices/{id}/attendance → paginated `{ items, total }` with `?page=&page_size=`
- **Dedup:** UniqueConstraint on (device_id, device_user_id, punched_at). Insert uses SQLite dialect's `on_conflict_do_nothing`; needs a small switch when running on Postgres in prod (deferred to dialect-routing later).
- **RawPunch:** new dataclass in zk/client.py modeling one device-reported record before normalization.

## F10 — Web devices page ✓
- **Tests:** 4/4 web vitest (2 home + 2 devices page: list fetch + form POST→refetch), typecheck + lint clean
- **Files:** apps/web/lib/api.ts (typed fetch client), app/devices/page.tsx (client component), `@tikko/shared-types` added as workspace dep
- **Notes:**
  - `@tikko/shared-types` linked via `workspace:*` in apps/web/package.json so the page imports `Device` types directly
  - Hit React 19 types-collision bug on layout.tsx (two @types/react copies — one from web's direct dep, one transitive through next-dom). Pragmatic patch: `{children as any}` cast in app/layout.tsx. Real fix is a `pnpm.overrides` to pin @types/react across the workspace; deferred because mobile uses React 18 and unified pinning needs more care.
  - Typed routes Link href cast `as never` for `/devices/[id]/attendance` since that route doesn't exist yet — will tighten in F11.

## F11 — Web attendance page ✓
- **Tests:** 6/6 web vitest (2 home + 2 devices + 2 attendance), typecheck + lint clean
- **Files:** app/devices/[id]/attendance/page.tsx (server component awaiting params), app/devices/[id]/attendance/AttendanceClient.tsx (client component), app/devices/[id]/attendance/__tests__/attendance.test.tsx
- **Notes:**
  - Page splits server (awaits Next 15 async params) + client (state + fetch). Tests run against the client component directly.
  - 'Poll now' button calls F09's POST /devices/:id/poll then refetches the list. Reports `{ polled, new }` count to the user.
  - Removed the `as never` cast from F10's Link now that the route exists.
- **Walking skeleton is now complete** — device register → poll → view attendance works end-to-end through web + api with mocked pyzk in tests.

## F12 — Auth: register + login + JWT ✓
- **Tests:** 23/23 (8 new auth tests), ruff clean
- **Files:** src/tikko/auth/{__init__,hashing,tokens}.py, src/tikko/models/user.py, src/tikko/schemas/user.py, src/tikko/routes/auth.py
- **Deps added:** bcrypt 5.0, pyjwt 2.12
- **Routes:** POST /auth/register (201, returns UserRead without password), POST /auth/login (200, returns access+refresh tokens), 409 on duplicate email, 401 on wrong password / unknown email (same message — no enumeration)
- **JWT claims:** sub (user id), role, type ("access"|"refresh"), iat, exp. HS256 signed with `TIKKO_JWT_SECRET`. TTLs from settings (default 15min access / 30 days refresh).
- **Notes:**
  - Password min length enforced at 10 chars in `UserCreate`; pydantic returns 422 on shorter
  - Role defaults to "employee"; `UserRole` is a `Literal` constrained to admin/manager/employee
  - InsecureKeyLengthWarning during tests because default `TIKKO_JWT_SECRET` is "change-me" — set a real secret in prod (`openssl rand -hex 32`)

## F13 — Auth middleware + role guards ✓
- **Tests:** 31/31 (8 new auth-guard tests, 15 existing tests updated to authenticate), ruff clean
- **Files:** src/tikko/auth/dependencies.py (CurrentUser dataclass, get_current_user, require_role), guards applied to 5 /devices routes, tests/conftest.py grew `admin_auth` fixture, 3 existing test files updated to pass the fixture
- **Route policy:**
  - `POST /devices`, `POST /devices/:id/test-connection` — admin only
  - `GET /devices`, `GET /devices/:id`, `POST /devices/:id/poll` — admin or manager
  - `GET /devices/:id/attendance` — any authenticated role
  - `/health`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/login` — public
- **Errors:** 401 (missing/bad/expired token) with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`; 403 (wrong role) with `role 'X' not allowed`
- **Retrospective:** Splitting auth into F12 (endpoints) and F13 (apply guards) caused churn — 15 existing tests had to be updated. Should have either bundled them or built auth into F07 from day one. Carry this lesson into F14+ planning: when a feature horizontally affects all existing endpoints/screens, scope it as one feature.

## F14 — Login flow (web + mobile) ✓
- **Tests:** web 11/11 (3 new auth + 2 new login), mobile 6/6 (3 new auth + 1 new login), typecheck + lint clean both
- **Web:** lib/auth.ts (localStorage round-trip), app/login/page.tsx (form → POST /auth/login → setToken → router.push("/devices")), lib/api.ts auto-injects Authorization header from getToken()
- **Mobile:** lib/auth.ts (expo-secure-store wrapper), lib/api.ts (fetch wrapper with auto-Authorization), app/login.tsx (TextInputs + Pressable button → router.replace("/"))
- **Storage:** web → localStorage; mobile → SecureStore (encrypted on iOS keychain / Android keystore)
- **Walking skeleton is now usable through the browser**: visit /login, sign in as an admin, /devices and /devices/:id/attendance work.

## F19 — Mock device harness ✓
- **Tests:** api 49/49 (6 new in `test_zk_fake.py`), ruff clean
- **Files:** `src/tikko/zk/fake.py` (new), `tests/test_zk_fake.py` (new)
- **Public surface:**
  - `FakeDevice(host, serial_number, firmware_version, platform, device_name, punches)` — mutable in-memory terminal state; `.add_punch(user_id, timestamp, status, punch)` appends a record.
  - `FakeZK` — drop-in for `zk.ZK(host, port=, timeout=)`. `.connect()` looks the host up in the module registry and returns a `FakeConnection`; raises `ConnectionError` (caught by `ZKClient` and re-raised as `ZKConnectionError`) if no device is registered for that host.
  - `use_fake_devices(*devices)` — context manager that monkeypatches the `ZK` symbol bound inside `tikko.zk.client` for the duration of the block, seeds the registry, and restores both on exit.
- **Why pure in-process instead of a TCP fake on :4370:** the F19 win we needed was killing `unittest.mock.patch("tikko.routes.devices.ZKClient.<method>")` from the integration tests — pre-F19 you had to know the import site to patch correctly, and adding a method to `ZKClient` meant updating every patch path. `use_fake_devices()` lets a test drive the real `ZKClient` end-to-end. A TCP-listening fake is a future feature (needed for testing the pyzk wire protocol itself, not callers of it).
- **Notes:**
  - `FakeConnection` returns dataclass instances with `user_id`/`timestamp`/`status`/`punch` attributes — that's exactly the shape `ZKClient.get_attendance()` reads, so no shim needed.
  - The context manager saves and restores the registry (not just the `ZK` symbol) so nested or accidentally-overlapping `use_fake_devices()` blocks don't leak fakes into each other.
  - Existing tests under `test_attendance.py` / `test_zk_test_connection.py` still use `patch.object` and remain green — F19 is additive, no migration required.
- **Followup:** swap the older patch-based tests over to `use_fake_devices` when next touching them (not a blocker).

## F20 — Employee CRUD ✓ (sync deferred to F20-sync)
- **Tests:** api 65/65 (16 new in `test_employees.py`), ruff clean
- **Files:** `src/tikko/models/employee.py`, `src/tikko/schemas/employee.py`, `src/tikko/routes/employees.py` (all new); `models/__init__.py` + `main.py` updated to register.
- **Routes:**
  - `POST /employees` (admin) — 201; 409 on duplicate `employee_code`; 422 on non-numeric code.
  - `GET /employees?page=&page_size=` (admin or manager) — `{items, total}`.
  - `GET /employees/:id` (admin or manager) — 200; 404 if absent.
  - `PATCH /employees/:id` (admin) — partial update over `full_name` + `status`; 422 on bad status; 404 if absent.
  - `DELETE /employees/:id` (admin) — 204; 404 if absent. Hard delete for now (soft-delete is a later concern; rows the device knows about would block deletion in a more careful design, but F20 is small on purpose).
- **Schema choices:**
  - `employee_code` constrained at the Pydantic layer to `^\d+$`, max 32 chars. **Why:** keeps it interchangeable with the ZK `uid` int — F20-sync will pass `int(employee_code)` straight into `pyzk.set_user(uid=…, user_id=…)` with no separate mapping table.
  - `status` is a `Literal["active", "inactive", "terminated"]`. `inactive` exists for the "on leave / contractor not currently scheduled" case so we don't have to choose between active and terminated when the right answer is "neither".
- **Why split sync into F20-sync:**
  - `all-features.md` F20 originally bundled "model + CRUD + sync". Splitting lets the CRUD surface stabilise before the device side touches it, and gives F20-sync a clean scope: just the `POST /employees/:id/sync` route plus `ZKClient.set_user` plus a matching `FakeConnection.set_user`. The `all-features.md` F20 checkbox stays open until F20-sync lands.
- **Notes:**
  - No Alembic migration yet (follows the existing pattern — tables created via `Base.metadata.create_all` in lifespan; followup carried in `todo.md`).
  - No `Employee ↔ User` linkage. They're different concepts: a `User` is an auth principal (admin/manager/employee), an `Employee` is a tracked human on a terminal. Joining them is a later feature, only if/when the mobile employee dashboard (F23) needs it.

## F20-sync — POST /employees/:id/sync ✓ (closes the `all-features.md` F20 line)
- **Tests:** api 75/75 (10 new in `test_employees_sync.py`), ruff clean
- **Files:**
  - `src/tikko/zk/client.py` — `ZKClient.set_user(user_id, name)` added: validates digits-only `user_id`, casts to `uid` int, calls `conn.set_user(uid=, name=, user_id=)`, wraps any pyzk exception as `ZKConnectionError`.
  - `src/tikko/zk/fake.py` — new `FakeSyncedUser` dataclass; `FakeDevice.synced_users: dict[str, FakeSyncedUser]`; `FakeConnection.set_user(...)` records the call (signature matches pyzk: `uid, name='', privilege=0, password='', group_id='', user_id='', card=0`).
  - `src/tikko/schemas/employee.py` — `EmployeeSyncRequest { device_ids: list[str] (min_length=1) }`, `EmployeeSyncEntry { device_id, status, error }`, `EmployeeSyncResult { results }`.
  - `src/tikko/routes/employees.py` — `POST /employees/:id/sync` handler (admin). 404 if employee absent, 400 if any `device_id` not in DB, otherwise iterates devices in **request order** and produces a per-device `{status, error?}` entry. `set_user` is wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` to keep the event loop free.
  - `tests/test_employees_sync.py` — 10 tests: single device, multi-device, request-order preservation, unreachable device → `status: failed`, mixed success/failure, missing employee (404), unknown `device_id` (400), empty list (422), employee role (403), no token (401).
- **Why per-device failures don't bubble to a 5xx:** the operator wants to know which devices took the user and which didn't, in one round trip. Returning 200 with a results array lets the web UI render "Synced to A, failed on B — retry?" without parsing partial-success out of an error body.
- **Why iterate in request order:** the `select(... in_(device_ids))` query returns rows in arbitrary order, but the caller chose a sequence (e.g. "front gate first, then back door"); preserving it keeps the result intuitive.
- **No DB persistence of sync state yet.** That belongs to F21 (when fingerprint templates land and we need a join table to track *which device has which template*). For now `synced_users` lives only on the (fake) device — real devices keep their own state.
- **Walking skeleton is now usable end-to-end through enrollment**: register employee → POST /employees/:id/sync against one or more devices → device knows the user.
