# Done

## F01 — Monorepo skeleton ✓
- **Tests:** smoke check — `pnpm install` resolves the workspace (prettier + turbo installed)
- **Files changed:** 13 new (root configs + tasks/ folder)
- **Lines:** +~300
- **Complexity:** Low — pure tooling/configs, no logic
- **Notes:**
  - `just` skipped (not installed); root `pnpm` scripts orchestrate everything, calling `uv run` for Python tasks. Can swap to `just` later if desired.
  - Single-deployable contract documented in CLAUDE.md — no branching on `TIKKO_DEPLOY_MODE` in business logic.
  - All env vars use `TIKKO_*` prefix.
  - Git initialized on `main` with per-feature commit convention.
